| Buffon's Needle |
+-----------------+

    "Suppose that you drop a short needle on ruled paper - what is then the
    probability that the needle comes to lie in a position where it crosses
    one of the lines?" - Georges Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon

    Buffon's probability experiment can be used as a Monte Carlo algorithm to
    approximate the value of π. In 1901, Mario Lazzarini used this method to
    come up with the approximation π ≈ 355/113. Here, we implement the resulting
    algorithm.
